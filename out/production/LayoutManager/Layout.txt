FlowLayout:
Arranges components in a left-to-right flow, much like lines of text in a paragraph. It wraps components to the next
line when there isn't enough horizontal space.

BorderLayout:
Divides the container into five regions: North, South, East, West, and Center. Each region can contain only one
component, and the Center expands to fill remaining space.

GridLayout:
Organizes components into a grid with a specified number of rows and columns. All cells are equal in size, and
components are placed in the grid in the order they are added.

GridBagLayout:
Offers a more flexible grid-based layout where components can span multiple rows or columns. It uses a set of
constraints for each component, allowing fine control over component positioning and sizing.

CardLayout:
Allows multiple components (or “cards”) to share the same display space, with only one card visible at a time.
It’s useful for creating wizard-like interfaces.
